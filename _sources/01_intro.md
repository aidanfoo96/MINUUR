# Introduction 

Hello! Thank you for your interest in MINUUR. MINUUR is a metagenomics workflow I developed to analyse the vast amount of mosquito whole genome sequencing data publicly available. Large scale sequencing efforts such as the AG-1000 genomes consortium and various other sequencing projects on the European Nucleotide Archive produce a huge amount of short read shotgun sequencing data pertaining to the mosquito. However, many of the reads not associated to the mosquito (unmapped reads), could be valuable metagenomic information to us microbiome researchers :) 

This workflow I developed serves two purposes 1. A way to reproduce a large amount of my work from my PhD, which involved creating a 'repository' of high-quality mosquito associated metagenome-assembeld genomes (MAGs) recovered from mosquito WGS data and 2. For those interested in following a similar approach, a (hopefully) straight forward way to re-do this anlaysis in an organism of your choosing
